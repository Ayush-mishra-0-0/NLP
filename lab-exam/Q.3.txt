Q.3 The data considered includes diseases or symptoms related to human health, collected from YouTube comments. However, there is a lack of information regarding the extent of coverage for various health issues. The intention is to first conduct fundamental exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the data to understand the different categories of health problems identified. Later, the categories can be specified with the optimal number of groups. Those groups' labels can be used to label the comments. Further, the tf-idf scheme is involved as a feature extractor for the purpose of classification, where the Logistic regression is to be employed for classification, which aims to predict classes for unseen data.
